"""Postprocessing tools for the `hst` homogeneous-shear-turbulence DNS.

Everything reads the hst / CPL output files through :mod:`post.io` (the single
source of truth for the binary layouts) and builds physical coordinates /
wavenumbers through :mod:`post.grid`.  Run tools from the command line with::

    python3 -m post <tool> [deck] [args]

``<deck>`` is the run directory or an ``hst.in``-style namelist path (default
``hst.in`` in the current directory); it is parsed for the mesh, box and
physics metadata that the binary field headers do not always carry (the
pressure files are headerless, and the grid coordinates are reconstructed
from ``ny``, ``ly`` and ``ystretch``).

Adding a new tool is adding one file in :mod:`post.tools` and one line in its
``TOOLS`` registry (see ``post/tools/__init__.py``).
